### Issue: Inadequate Validation of Constructor Parameters

#### Severity: Low

#### Description:
The `_Settlement_handler_init` function lacks validation checks for the input parameters, particularly `_chain` and `_token`. Without proper validation, there is a risk of incorrect initialization by the owner, which could lead to potential issues, such as using an invalid or unsupported chain or a zero address for the token.

- **_chain**: The chain parameter is a string and could potentially be set to an invalid or unsupported value, leading to operational issues.
- **_token**: The `_token` address could be set to the zero address, which would cause failures in operations that expect a valid ERC20 token address.

#### Part code:

``` solidity 
    function _Settlement_handler_init(
        address _owner,
        SettlementMode _mode,
        address _token,
        address _verifier,
        string memory _chain,
        address _settlement
    ) public {
        __Ownable_init(_owner);
        __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
        settlement = ISettlement(_settlement);
        verifier = ISettlementSignatureVerifier(_verifier);
        mode = _mode;
        token = _token;
        chain = _chain;
    }
```

#### Recommendation:
1. **Chain Validation**:
   - Implement a validation mechanism for the `_chain` parameter. One approach could be to maintain a mapping of supported chains, allowing the owner to select only from the available options.
   - Alternatively, add a check to ensure that the provided chain value is valid and supported.

   ```solidity
   mapping(string => bool) public supportedChains;

   require(supportedChains[_chain], "Unsupported chain.");
   ```

2. **Token Address Validation**:
   - Add a check to ensure that the `_token` address is not set to the zero address.

   ```solidity
   require(_token != address(0), "Invalid token address.");
   ```
