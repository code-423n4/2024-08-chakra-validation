# Unnecessary Variable
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-chakra/blob/d0d45ae1d26ca1b87034e67180fac07ce9642fd9/solidity/settlement/contracts/ChakraSettlement.sol#L216-L228
The variable `result` on line 216 is created and used only once. It could be eliminated from the code entirely and the contract call result tested directly.
