# Recommended modification of access control to initialization function
```
    function _Settlement_handler_init(
        address _owner,
        SettlementMode _mode,
        address _token,
        address _verifier,
        string memory _chain,
        address _settlement
    ) public { /// note: modify internal or private
        __Ownable_init(_owner);
        __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
        settlement = ISettlement(_settlement);
        verifier = ISettlementSignatureVerifier(_verifier);
        mode = _mode;
        token = _token;
        chain = _chain;
    }
```

```
    function _Settlement_init(
        string memory _chain_name,
        uint256 _chain_id,
        address _owner,
        address[] memory _managers,
        uint256 _required_validators,
        address _signature_verifier
    ) public { /// note: modify internal or private
        __Ownable_init(_owner);
        __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
        _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _owner);

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _managers.length; i++) {
            _grantRole(MANAGER_ROLE, _managers[i]);
        }

        chain_id = _chain_id;
        contract_chain_name = _chain_name;
        required_validators = _required_validators;
        signature_verifier = ISettlementSignatureVerifier(_signature_verifier);
    }
```
The above function is an init function that is called when initializing the handler and settlement contracts.

There is no problem yet thanks to the ```__Ownable_init``` and ```__UUPSUpgradeable_init``` functions, but there is a potential problem that may arise in the future development stage because the initializa-related functions are public, so it is recommended to modify the access control to ```private``` or ```internal```.
