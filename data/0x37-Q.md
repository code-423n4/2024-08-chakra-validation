[L01] Improper from_address in Cairo's CrossChainResult event.
When we trigger receive_cross_chain_callback() in the source chain, we will emit one event. In this event, there is one `from_address`. The from address should be the original user to bridge tokens. But here the from_address is the chakra network. Because chakra network triggers this receive_cross_chain_callback(), not the original user.
This will cause wrong parameter for this event. If one system monitor these event and do some operation based on these event, this may cause some errors.
```javascript
            self.emit(CrossChainResult {
                cross_chain_settlement_id: cross_chain_msg_id,
                from_address: get_tx_info().unbox().account_contract_address,
                from_chain: to_chain,
                from_handler: to_handler,
                to_chain: from_chain,
                to_handler: from_handler,
                cross_chain_msg_status: state,
            });
```
